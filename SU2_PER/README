The SU2_PER is a fortran serial executable that generates periodic mesh for SU2.
The code was developed by Antonio Ghidoni from the University of Brescia.

TO COMPILE
run the compiling script "./COMPILE" available in the folder.


TO RUN
run the program followed by a "<" sign and the SU2 config file "./SU2_PER < su2config.cfg".
The SU2_PER program uses the same config options of the SU2_MSH binary.


LIMITATIONS

1) It can only be run in serial
2) To avoid that the program occupies too much memory SU2_PER is limited to mesh containing 
   less than 1E+05 periodic nodes and less than 8E+06 nodes in total. However, 
   if bigger meshes must be converted, this limit can be adjusted by modifying line 35 of 
   the su2_periodic.f90 file.
